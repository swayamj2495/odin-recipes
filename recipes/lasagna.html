    <h3>Description :-</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich fillings such as meat sauce, cheese, and béchamel. Traditionally, it includes a savory ragù (often made with ground beef, pork, or sausage simmered in tomato sauce and herbs), ricotta or béchamel for creaminess, and plenty of melted mozzarella and Parmesan for flavor. The layers are stacked in a baking dish and baked until bubbly, golden, and slightly crispy on top.</p>
    <p>There are many variations worldwide: some use vegetables like spinach, zucchini, or eggplant in place of meat, while others feature seafood or even purely cheese-based fillings. In Italy, different regions have their own takes—for example, Lasagna alla Bolognese uses slow-cooked ragù with béchamel, while southern versions might rely more heavily on ricotta and tomato sauce.</p>
    <p>Lasagna is often served as a hearty main course, especially at family gatherings, holidays, and celebrations. It’s beloved for its comforting balance of flavors, satisfying texture, and ability to feed a crowd.</p>
