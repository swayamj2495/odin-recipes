# 🍝 Recipe Website (HTML Practice)

This is a simple **static HTML project** showcasing recipes with proper structuring using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.  
It was created as a practice project to learn and apply **basic HTML tags** such as `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<img>`, and `<a>`.

## 📖 Features
- **Navigation** – Link back to the homepage (`index.html`).  
- **Images** – Each recipe has a food image with proper `alt` text.  
- **Ingredients** – Organized using unordered lists.  
- **Recipe Steps** – Ordered instructions with nested lists.  
- **Semantic HTML** – Proper use of headings (`h1`, `h3`, `h4`).
